How to know problem is dp?

-> there will be 2 things
        a) there will be given to take choice
               -> weather to include ele or not
               -> there will be 2 function call ( 2 recursion call is same problem )
        b) would be asked to have optimal solution
               -> greatest, smallest, largest
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

solution are find as
    step1 -> think about recursive
    step2 -> memoization
    step3 -> top - down approach
